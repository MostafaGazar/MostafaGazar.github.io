talk-description: Google Cloud Platform and Firebase have an entire suite of serverless tools that can help build intelligent apps. What is serverless? It means cloud power available instantly and transparently, without having to create any virtual machines or manage scaling or application runtimes. See how GCP and serverless can make your app's backend more powerful, easier to build, easier to manage, and cheaper. We'll explore compute products like Google Cloud Functions, big data tools like Firestore and BigQuery, and machine learning tools.

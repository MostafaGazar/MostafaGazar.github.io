talk-description: My talk discusses why localisation is important to broaden app reach and increase accessibility. It will mainly focus on store localisation as a starting point for testing audience demand for localisation. I will discuss tools and resources that can help with localisation and publishing automation.
 I’ll talk about localisation vs translation, and how to build a localisation team. I’ll discuss keeping branding consistent across locales, devices, and ecosystems, and common pitfalls when localising. I’ll make suggestions for determining what locales to start with based on audience.
 Finally, I’ll show how to put it all together, how to monitor and analyse the results, and possible next steps.
speaker-bio: I'm a 30-something ex-pat Kiwi living on the Gold Coast in Australia. Mother of four fur-children. Blue is my natural hair colour.

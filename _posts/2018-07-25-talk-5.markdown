talk-title: Flutter from idea to app in minutes
talk-description: Native mobile development often means spending a lot of time waiting for a compile only to get 90% done and boom, compiler error, or worse it compiles and while testing runtime crash. Is there a way to reduce the feedback loop and develop performance and stable application? Yes, yes there is Flutter. 
 
 In Google own words ""Flutter is Googleâ€™s mobile app SDK for crafting high-quality native interfaces on iOS and Android in record time. Flutter works with existing code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free and open source."" 
 - https://flutter.io/
 
 In this talk will see how we will see how to use flutter, to prove how fast it can be to create an app we will build an app in less time than compiling Android. I'm not talking about another Hello word. I mean a real application that you might find in the app store, with everything from user management, a database, data syncing, and user-to-user communication.

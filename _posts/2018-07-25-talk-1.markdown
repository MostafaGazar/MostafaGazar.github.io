talk-title: Mobile Testing, Automation, Manual or Hybrid
talk-description: In this day and age more and more people are relying on their mobile devices to run their business or their lives. They expect constant updates to their operating systems and applications and don't tolerate failures lightly turning to social media very very quickly. So quality and testing specifically targeted at the mobile market is paramount - so should testing be purely a manual based activity, a purely automated based activity or as we believe a hybrid of both automation and manual. Our presentation looks at how to get the best from both skillsets to fit a 21st Century Mobile model and prepare for the 22nd Century and what the future has in store for us all.

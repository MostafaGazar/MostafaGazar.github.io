talk-title: Golang ‚ù§Ô∏è Mobile
talk-description: This talk will be an intro to the golang programing language, which was originally developed at Google.
 We'll then take a look at how you can use it in the mobile space - including a demo of writing a go library which compiles to a binary which will run in both native Android and ios apps. Allowing for sharing of core logic libraries across both platforms.
speaker-name: Bridget Cowie
speaker-bio: Co-organiser of the Wellington golang meetup. I am not a mobile developer, but I do love my phone üòÅ

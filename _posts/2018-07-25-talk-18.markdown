talk-description: Coming from an academic and practical background, we’ve experimented with the latest in iOS and machine learning to create a prototype for use in sports development of young people. We’ve combined our passions of rowing and programming to attempt to fill the void in data analysis and prediction in sport. 
 
 Testing the new CoreML tools announced at WWDC2018 against academic ML application we endeavor to connect two of our passions together to improve the sport we love.
